    <p>A common mistake many aspiring Colorado hikers make is to target
      Longs Peak before they have the fitness or experience to stack the odds
      of a successful summit in their favor. Here’s where Mount Bierstadt comes
      into play. The popular 14,060’ peak off of Guanella Pass near Georgetown
      is an accommodating 6-mile round trip along a well-maintained trail.
      It’s a great starter mountain for those hoping to hike all of Colorado’s
      58 14,000’ summits (the eponymous 14ers).

    <p>More experienced hikers can test their mettle on Sawtooth Ridge, a 1-mile
     stretch of Class 3 rock that connects the summit of Bierstadt with the
     shoulder of 13,842’ Mount Spaulding and eventually 14,264’ Mount Evans.
      The typical descent back to Guanella Pass involves bushwhacking through
       moose-infested swampland, where 7-foot tall willows create a natural garden maze.</p>
